# Minesweeper

Minesweeper game created to work on JS functions, losely based on Ania Kubow YT tutorial. 

I applied my own logic to adding majority of classes and I wrote recursion functions.

Also media queries had been written for purpose of this application. 

## How to play

To win, you need to find all 20 bombs. 
Left click opens the square, right one puts an 'F' for flag where the player think the bomb is. 

If game is lost, the flags put on fields without bombs will show X on black background. 
The flags that are correct will remain the same. 

## Achievments:
- adjusting basic version for a mobile use
- creating a media query for a large screen 
- adding class style depending on total
- deployment 
- amount of flags used left showing
- 'Game Over!' and 'VICTORY' displaying accordingly
- black square with x showing if player was wrong about the flag
- showing if player was wrong about the flag
